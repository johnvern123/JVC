Following this history, for both researchers and seasoned practitioners XP 2019 provided an informal environment to network, share, and discover trends in Agile for the next 20 years The 15 full papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 45 submissions. They were organized in topical sections named: agile adoption, agile practices; large-scale agile; agility beyond IT, and the future of agile.</p>
